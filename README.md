# LearningGaussianGraphicalModels

### Project Description
- Validated the effectiveness of the GreedyAndPrune algorithm for learning Gaussian Graphical Models (GGM).
- Conducted a comprehensive comparison of sample complexities between GreedyAndPrune and conventional algorithms.
- Addressed the challenge of learning tree-structured Gaussian Graphical Models using independent and identically distributed samples, unravelling the intricate interplay of variables within this elegant framework.
- Presented theoretical complexity bounds for a polynomial time tree structure learning algorithm(Chow-Liu Algorithm).
- This analysis unveils essential sample requirements for precise inference and illuminates the algorithmâ€™s efficiency.
- The profound implications of these complexity bounds transcend mere algorithmic understanding, rendering this pioneering research a potential cornerstone for groundbreaking contributions in top-tier academic journals.
